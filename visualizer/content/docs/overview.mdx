# Overview

Polymarket BTC 15m Assistant is an analytics tool for Polymarket's Bitcoin Up or Down 15-minute prediction markets. It combines technical analysis, market microstructure, and a robust edge model to surface probabilistic insights—not trading advice.

## What It Does

- **Live dashboard** — Real-time view of model probabilities, market prices, and edge quality
- **Robust edge scoring** — Only flags opportunities when edge survives uncertainty, time feasibility, and execution cost adjustments
- **Neutral framing** — Uses PASS/WATCH language; no "trade now" or buy recommendations

## Key Concepts

- **Model probability (p)** — TA-derived probability of UP or DOWN
- **Market price (q)** — Polymarket implied probability
- **Robust edge** — edge_low × time_mult − exec_cost, only when criteria are met
- **Time feasibility** — Distance to strike vs expected move; low time remaining reduces effective edge

## Not Financial Advice

This tool is for research and education. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Use at your own risk.
