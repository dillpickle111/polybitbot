# Polymarket BTC 15m Assistant

## A YC-Style Brief

**Problem:** Polymarket's Bitcoin Up or Down 15-minute markets are noisy. Raw model-vs-market edges often ignore uncertainty, time feasibility, and execution cost. Traders need a conservative, defensible signal—not hype.

**Solution:** A robust edge model that only surfaces WATCH when:
- Edge survives a 90% one-sided uncertainty discount (p_low = p − 1.28σ)
- Time feasibility is sufficient (distance to strike vs expected move)
- Execution cost (fees, slippage, spread) is subtracted
- ROI and Kelly thresholds are met

**Design principles:**
- Neutral language: PASS/WATCH, never "trade now"
- Disclaimer gate before dashboard access
- No execution; analytics only

## Methodology

### Model Probability (p)

TA-derived probability from RSI, MACD, VWAP slope, Heiken Ashi. Time-aware decay applied as the 15m window closes.

### Market Price (q)

Polymarket implied probability from best bid/ask.

### Uncertainty (σ)

Rolling standard deviation of p over the last 30 updates. Floor: 2%. No backtest calibration by default.

### Robust Edge

```
p_low     = p − 1.28×σ
edge_low  = p_low − q
robust    = edge_low × time_mult − exec_cost
```

Recommend only if robust > 0, robust_roi ≥ 10%, time_mult ≥ 35%, kelly ≥ 0.25%.

## Limits

- 1–5 second data latency
- No execution; user trades manually
- Not financial advice
