# Risk + Limits

## Disclaimers

- **Not financial advice** — This tool is for research and education only
- **No guarantees** — Past performance does not predict future results
- **Use at your own risk** — You are responsible for your own decisions
- **No execution** — The tool does not place trades; it only displays analytics

## System Limits

- **Data latency** — 1–5 second delays; not suitable for high-frequency use
- **API rate limits** — Binance, Polymarket, and RPC providers may throttle
- **Geo restrictions** — Binance may be unavailable in some regions
- **Model uncertainty** — σ is estimated from rolling history; no backtest calibration by default

## Robust Edge Safeguards

- Only surfaces WATCH when robust_edge, robust_roi, time_mult, and kelly thresholds are met
- Uses conservative p_low (90% one-sided) to discount model overconfidence
- Time feasibility reduces edge when strike is far and time is short
